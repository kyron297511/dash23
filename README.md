# Welcome to the official repo for the Lotus Project website!
This repo is used to store the source code for the website utilized by lotus. we do not suggest trying to run a local copy of this on your own because this is still under heavy development, but this readme will be updated at some point to guide you thru setting a fork up and also list the file hierarchy for easier understanding of what goes where.
